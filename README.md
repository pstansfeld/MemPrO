## Installation

### pip (recommended)

```
pip install mempro
```

### From source

Clone the GitHub repository. Python 3.11 or later is required, along with the following packages:

* JAX 0.6.0 or later (CPU):
```
pip install "jax[cpu]>=0.6.0"
```
* JAX with CUDA support (GPU, optional):
```
pip install "jax[cuda]>=0.6.0"
```
* Matplotlib 3.8.4 or later:
```
pip install "matplotlib>=3.8.4"
```

A Martini 3 forcefield file is also required and can be downloaded from [here](https://cgmartini.nl/docs/downloads/force-field-parameters/martini3/particle-definitions.html). When running from source, place the `.itp` file in the same directory as `MemPrO.py`, or supply its path using the `-itp` flag.

MemPrO is also accessible on Google Colab via the link [ADD LINK]. The Colab will contain instructions for use. (Currently the Colab is WIP and this will be updated.)

## Running MemPrO

### From source

```
python PATH/TO/MemPrO.py -f input_file.pdb
```

### Installed via pip

```
mempro -f input_file.pdb
```

No environment variables are required. By default MemPrO will use all available CPU cores and look for `Insane4MemPrO.py` and `martini_v3.itp` in the same directory as the script (or the installed package directory). These paths can be overridden with the `-insane` and `-itp` flags if needed.

## Outputs

MemPrO is intended to be run on PDB files, and will output the following files:

* **orientation.txt** — Contains general information about all of the final minima. In general rank 1 is the best orientation, however there are cases where this is not true. `orientation.txt` can then be used to determine the best orientation.

* **local_minima_orientation.png** — A representation of how spread out the local minima are. The more white the image, the more confidence can be placed in rank 1. This is only true in general and there are some cases where this can be safely ignored.

* **local_minima_potential.png** — A representation of the potential of the final configuration from a given starting configuration. This complements `local_minima_orientation.png` but in general does not provide much additional information.

* **Rank_{n}/** — A folder containing all relevant information for a particular rank:
  * `oriented_rank_{n}.pdb` — The nth ranked configuration. Contains the protein (atomistic or coarse grain depending on the input) and a dummy membrane. The rank is based on number of hits (or potential, see `-rank` flag).
  * `info_rank_{n}.txt` — Some information about the orientation.
  * `CG_System_rank_{n}/` — A CG system built using Insane4MemPrO for the rank N configuration, including a topology file. Only produced when using `-bd` and `-bd_args`.
  * `PG_potential_curve.png` — The potential curve for the position of the PG cell wall. Only produced with `-pg`.
  * `cross-section_area_curve.png` — The cross-sectional area of the segment of the protein passing through the PG layer. Only produced with `-pg`.
  * `Z_potential_curve.png` — Potential against Z position of the final orientation. Gives an idea of the nature of the minima.
  * `curv_potential_curve.png` — Potential against global membrane curvature for the final orientation. Can indicate whether curvature minimisation should be used.

## Flags

**-h, --help** — Displays a help message with all possible flags.

**-f, --file_name** — Input PDB file for the protein to orient. The protein can be either atomistic or coarse grained; the code detects which automatically and ignores unknown atom/bead types. It is recommended that the PDB file has no missing atoms, as this can reduce orientation quality.

**-o, --output** — Name of the output directory. Defaults to `Orient/` in the current working directory.

**-ni, --iters** — Maximum number of minimisation iterations. The default of 150 is sufficient in most cases. Reducing this value increases speed; increasing it can sometimes improve results on difficult systems.

**-ng, --grid_size** — Number of initial starting configurations. Defaults to 36. For best efficiency this should be a multiple of the number of CPUs being used. More starting configurations sample the space of minima better, but there are diminishing returns and generally no more than 40 are needed.

**-nc, --num_cpus** — Number of CPU cores (or GPU devices) to use. Defaults to all available cores. For best performance with `-ng`, set `-nc` to a value that divides `-ng` evenly.

**-p, --platform** — Compute platform: `cpu` (default) or `gpu`. Use `gpu` only with `jax[cuda]` installed.

**-rank, --rank** — Ranking method for minima: `h` ranks by percentage hits, `p` ranks by potential, `auto` (default) ranks by a value calculated from approximate minima depth and potential.

**-dm, --dual_membrane** — Toggles dual membrane minimisation. Splits the membrane into an inner and outer membrane and minimises the distance between them. Only use this if your protein spans the periplasm or is a gap junction etc.

**-ch, --charge** — Partial charge of the (inner) membrane. The value corresponds to the average charge on a lipid divided by the average area per lipid, representing the average charge across the bilayer sheet. For an E. coli inner membrane this is around -0.008. Default is 0, which gives the best performance in most cases.

**-ch_o, --charge_outer** — Charge for the outer membrane only. Has no effect without `-dm`.

**-mt, --membrane_thickness** — Initial thickness of the (inner) membrane in Angstroms. Default is 28.

**-mt_o, --outer_membrane_thickness** — Initial thickness of the outer membrane in Angstroms. Has no effect without `-dm`. Default is 24.

**-mt_opt, --membrane_thickness_optimisation** — Toggles membrane thickness optimisation. Cannot be used with `-c`.

**-tm, --transmembrane_residues** — Indicates which residues are expected to be transmembrane. Format is a comma-separated list of inclusive-exclusive ranges e.g. `10-40,50-60`. Intended only for situations where the transmembrane region is known and MemPrO is consistently orienting incorrectly. Cannot be used with `-w`.

**-pg, --predict_pg_layer** — Toggles PG cell wall prediction for dual membrane minimisations. Outputs a dummy PG layer at the lowest potential position and two diagnostic graphs. Due to the nature of the PG layer the lowest potential is not necessarily the biologically correct placement; it is recommended to use the graphs for further interpretation. Requires `-dm`.

**-pg_guess, --pg_layer_guess** — An initial guess for the PG layer position, typically based on standard PG layer positions in a specific bacterium.

**-pr, --peripheral** — Use an alternative method for determining initial insertion depth. The usual method places the weighted mean of the hydrophobic residues at the membrane centre, which does not work well for peripheral membrane proteins. The alternative method scans all possible insertion depths within a range. Does not work with `-dm`.

**-w, --use_weights** — Toggles use of b-factors to weight the minimisation. Useful if part of your protein is particularly flexible or poorly predicted by AlphaFold. Do not use this if all b-factors are 0. Cannot be used with `-tm`.

**-wb, --write_bfactors** — Writes individual bead potentials to the b-factors of the output PDB. Useful for diagnosing orientation problems. Not currently compatible with `-c`.

**-c, --curvature** — Toggles global curvature minimisation. Not currently compatible with `-dm` or `-mt_opt`.

**-flip, --flip** — Flips the protein in the Z-axis on output.

**-itp, --itp_file** — Path to a Martini 3 `.itp` file. Defaults to `martini_v3.itp` in the same directory as `MemPrO.py` (or the installed package directory).

**-insane, --insane_path** — Path to `Insane4MemPrO.py`. Defaults to the same directory as `MemPrO.py` (or the installed package directory). Only required when using `-bd`.

**-bd, --build_system** — Number of final ranked configurations to build as CG MD-ready systems using Insane4MemPrO. Currently only works with coarse grain input files.

**-bd_args, --build_arguments** — Arguments to pass to Insane4MemPrO, primarily lipid composition, solvent type etc. Required when using `-bd`.

**-res, --additional_residues** — Comma-separated list of additional residues present in the input file (e.g. `POPE,POPG`).

**-res_itp, --additional_residues_itp_file** — An `.itp` file describing each additional residue. Required when using `-res`.

**-res_cg, --residue_cg_file** — A folder containing files named `RES.pdb` for each additional residue, providing coarse graining information. Examples can be found in the [CG2AT repository](https://github.com/owenvickery/cg2at/tree/master/database/fragments/martini_3-0_slipids/non_protein). Only required for atomistic inputs with additional residues.

## Examples

The examples below use `python PATH/TO/MemPrO.py`; if installed via pip, replace this with `mempro`.

Orient `input_file.pdb` on a grid of 40 starting configurations with 150 minimisation iterations:

```
python PATH/TO/MemPrO.py -f input_file.pdb -o Output_dir/ -ng 40 -ni 150
```

Orient with global curvature minimisation and write per-bead potentials to b-factors:

```
python PATH/TO/MemPrO.py -f input_file.pdb -o Output_dir/ -ng 40 -ni 150 -c -wb
```

Orient with a dual membrane system, then build the top 2 ranked configurations as CG systems. The inner membrane contains POPE, POPG and CARD; the outer membrane contains LIPA:

```
python PATH/TO/MemPrO.py -f input_file.pdb -o Output_dir/ -ng 40 -ni 150 -dm -bd 2 -bd_args "-negi_c0 CL -posi_c0 NA -sol W -l POPE:7 -l POPG:2 -l CARD:1 -uo LIPA"
```

Orient using 8 CPU cores:

```
python PATH/TO/MemPrO.py -f input_file.pdb -o Output_dir/ -nc 8
```

Orient using a GPU:

```
python PATH/TO/MemPrO.py -f input_file.pdb -o Output_dir/ -p gpu
```

### Examples

These instructions walk through building a CG system with a curved membrane containing multiple proteins.

First, create a template:

```
python PATH/TO/Insane4MemPrO.py -l POPE -sol W -x 10 -y 10 -z 50 -o test.gro -p topol.top -curv 0.1,0.15,1 -fudge 0.3 -curv_ext 6 -ct template.pdb -negi_c0 CL -posi_c0 NA
```

This creates a POPE-only membrane in a (10,10,50) box (automatically enlarged if needed to accommodate the curvature). The curvature `0.1,0.15,1` specifies a peak curvature of 0.1, a base curvature of 0.15, and the curved region pointing in the positive Z direction, maintained for 6 Å before returning to planar.

Next, open `template.pdb` in PyMOL. Protein positions are indicated by b-factors. Select a single bead at each desired protein location and run `alter sele,b=N` where N increments by 1 for each protein (the Nth protein will be placed at the bead with b-factor N). Once all b-factors are set, run `save template.pdb`.

Then build the final system:

```
python PATH/TO/Insane4MemPrO.py -l POPE -sol W -x 10 -y 10 -z 50 -o test.gro -p topol.top -curv 0.1,0.15,1 -fudge 0.3 -curv_ext 6 -in_t template.pdb -fs prots.txt -negi_c0 CL -posi_c0 NA
```

Ensure all membrane-relevant values match the template command. `-in_t` supplies the edited template and `-fs` supplies a text file listing the same number of proteins as edited b-factors. The `-p` flag produces a rudimentary `.top` file; protein-related entries will need to be updated but all other values are correct.

More detailed tutorials are available [here](Insane4MemPrO_tutorials.md).

## My protein didn't orient correctly

If your protein hasn't oriented correctly there are a number of things to try:

* Check all orientations by loading `orientations.pdb` and reviewing `orientations.txt`. The correct orientation may not be rank 1.
* Check `curv_potential_curve.png` to see if your protein prefers a curved membrane. If so, using `-c` will help.
* Check the PDB file for missing atoms or residues, which can cause the surface to be incorrectly evaluated. Missing atoms should be fixed before orientation.
* Using `-wb` can be helpful for diagnosing missing atoms — it writes the potential contribution of each residue as a b-factor, viewable in PyMOL.
* If your protein is a peripheral membrane protein, using `-pr` will help greatly. In some cases `-pr` will also help integral membrane proteins.
* MemPrO runs with a membrane charge of 0 by default. Some proteins that associate with the membrane through charge interactions will not orient correctly at 0 charge. For these, using `-ch` (or `-ch_o` for the outer membrane) to set the charge will help. Values around `-0.005` are a good starting point.
